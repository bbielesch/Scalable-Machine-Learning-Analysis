# Scalable-Machine-Learning-Analysis

This Github repository contains part of the code for my master thesis "Scalable Machine Learning with Multimedia Data". 
The code in this repository contains source code for the analysis of the execution of the machine learning scenarios on an 
Apache Spark cluster. The master thesis will be finalized till the end of August 2017. Till then this repository should be 
regarded as work in progress.
